The repository that I have forked was a HTML based one.I have made certain changes so that it looks more aggressive than the original one.

I have used HTML and Cascading Style sheets to modify it.
I have kept the data entered in a point wise order.
I have inserted an image for download and disclaimer to make the eyes of viewer get attracted to the data they want quickly .
Also added a background image to make it more attractive and easier to see it for longer time by reducing the white colour intensity.and increased the font-size of the last paragraph.
