Crudd's Forward Me

Well, here's my newest reverse me.  Actually, its kinda reversed already.
Guess whut that means you have to do.  Thats right, put it all together
and make a working PE file.  It shouldnt be too hard for seasoned reversers
and will be a good learnig experience for the rest of us.

Things you'll need to do:
	Add/Create the Dos Stub/PE Header
	Figure out which section is which
	Put it all together, and make it run
	Have fun :)
